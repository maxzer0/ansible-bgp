# ansible-bgp

This is an ongoing attempt to do configuration management for multiple peering servers.

If this project doesn't seem up to your standards, this is not meant to be used in an production environment.

This was my first time writing a bigger Ansible playbook. It is as of 13.10.21 still missing the playbook for setting up a server ready to peer.

Hosts are divided by country.

My current peering partners can be found under vars/peers.
